## Installation
To run this project, ensure Python is installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `nltk`
- `scikit-learn`
- `wordcloud`

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn wordcloud
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd resume-screening
Place your resume dataset in CSV format named resume_dataset.csv in the project directory.

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook resumeScreening.ipynb
Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform resume screening.

Data
The project uses a CSV file named resume_dataset.csv containing resumes along with their respective categories. The dataset should include at least the following columns:

Resume: The text content of the resume.
Category: The category to which the resume belongs.
Features
Data loading and preprocessing.
Unique category identification and frequency analysis.
Text cleaning and tokenization.
Visualization of resume categories using count plots and pie charts.
Word frequency analysis using word clouds.
TF-IDF feature extraction for text data.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier for resume categorization.
Visualizations
The project includes visualizations to understand the distribution of resume categories and the frequency of words in the resumes. Key visualizations include:

Count plots for category distribution.
Pie charts showing the proportion of different categories.
Word clouds representing the most common words in the resumes.
Model Training
The project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to categorize resumes. The model is trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a test set, providing accuracy metrics and a classification report.
